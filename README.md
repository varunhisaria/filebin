# filebin
Filebin is an anonymous file sharing web app where users can upload files upto 20 mb. A unique link is generated for each uploaded file, which can be shared with the intended receiver of the file. Each file can be downloaded only once, and any user trying to download a file after it has already been downloaded should get an error.
